# What is this repo?

Given the confidentiality of the impact evaluation of the PNIS project, the full repository and the organized files cannot be shared until further notice by the funding institution. Here I share the Stata dofiles for the replication authored by me and Lucas Marin Llanes, the other RA with which I worked during the project. Dofiles written entirely by me are authored as "AUTOR: Gustavo Castillo".
